# Where Is The New Oil?

Hello,

If you're reading this you probably are asking yourself where all of the repo's of The New Oil are. Right?

Well, if that's the case, you need to look on gitlab instead of github. As The New Oil has officially decided to drop github a while ago.

Now... Why this is i won't say. But what i can tell you (again) is that The New Oil is (again) on gitlab now. And as such, you (again) need to look there for their repo's instead.

Clear now? Okay... Bye, Bye.
